# P1-Image-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-AICTE-Internship

I have done this project to classify images using CNN Model and pre-trained Mobile Net Model. I created streamlit app for the same.

# Key features
Dual Model Support:

MobileNetV2 (ImageNet): Recognizes 1,000 different classes from the ImageNet dataset, including everyday objects, animals, and vehicles.
Custom CIFAR-10 Model: Specializes in classifying images into one of ten specific categories such as airplanes, automobiles, and birds.
Intuitive Interface:

Navigation Bar: Seamlessly switch between MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models using a sleek sidebar menu.
Real-Time Classification: Upload an image to receive immediate predictions with confidence scores.
Educational and Practical Use:

Ideal for learning about deep learning models and their performance.
Useful for practical applications where image classification is needed.
